        <h2>Decription:</h2>
        <p>Warm yeast rolls, fresh from the oven</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed </li>
            <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's® RapidRise Yeast </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sugar </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>½ cup milk </li>
            <li>¼ cup water </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter OR margarine </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 3/4 cup flour, undissolved yeast, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Heat milk, water and butter until very warm (120 degrees to 130 degrees F). 
                Add to flour mixture. Beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add 1/4 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed. 
                Stir in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Cover; let rest 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 12 equal pieces; shape into balls. Place in greased 8-inch round pan. 
                Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated 375 degrees F oven for 20 minutes or until done. 
                Remove from pan; brush with additional melted butter, if desired. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
